# Repository Guidelines

## Overview

Revista is an Astro 7 static site for photography, writing, and CV content.
It uses MDX content collections, vanilla Astro components with inline scripts for interactivity, and Tailwind CSS v4.
Primary runtime and package manager: Bun. Some helper scripts still run through Node.

## Rule Sources

- This `AGENTS.md` is the only agent-instruction file currently present in the repo.
- No `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` files were found during inspection.
- If any of those files are added later, merge their instructions into this document.

## Build, Lint, Test, and Dev Commands

Use Bun by default.

```sh
bun install                    # install dependencies
bun run dev                    # Astro dev server
bun run start                  # alias for dev
bun run build                  # production build; also runs the prebuild hook
bun run preview                # preview built site from dist/
bun run prebuild               # sync README/doc version badges
bun run lint:html              # validate generated HTML in dist/
bun run lint:links             # check internal links from dist/index.html
bun run lint:site              # full quality gate: build + html + links
bun x astro check              # project-wide Astro/type/content validation
bun x prettier --check .       # formatting check
bun x prettier --write .       # format entire repo
bun run create                 # interactive content creation wizard
bun run update-post            # update content frontmatter
node scripts/parser.js         # verify CLI/content schema drift
```

## Single-Test / Targeted Verification

The repository has a Playwright end-to-end test suite (83 tests across 14 spec files).

```sh
bunx playwright test                                    # run full test suite
bunx playwright test tests/spec-name.spec.ts            # run a single spec file
bunx playwright test -g "test name pattern"             # run tests matching a pattern
bun x astro check                                       # quickest project-wide type/content check
bun x prettier --check src/path/to/file.astro           # single-file formatting check
bun x html-validate dist/path/to/page.html              # validate one generated page
bun x hyperlink dist/path/to/page.html --skip-external
```

- Content-only or markup edits: start with the narrowest command.
- Layout, routing, or build changes: prefer `bun run lint:site` before handoff.
- Component or script changes: run relevant Playwright specs to verify behavior.

## Build Pipeline Facts

- `bun run build` triggers `prebuild` automatically via package scripts.
- `prebuild` runs `scripts/sync-readme-versions.js`.
- `lint:html` and `lint:links` require built files in `dist/`.
- Build concurrency is set to 4 in `astro.config.mjs` to avoid rate-limiting `image.erfi.io`.

## Remote Image Handling

- Remote images from `image.erfi.io` are downloaded and transformed during production builds.
- Astro caches processed images in `node_modules/.astro/assets/`; a warm cache avoids re-downloading.
- `src/scripts/undici-retry.ts` configures a global `RetryAgent` for build-time HTTP fetches with exponential backoff (5 retries, 1s-60s), 120s body timeout, and 6 max connections.
- The Dockerfile is a bare BusyBox httpd image that copies a pre-built `dist/`; it runs no image processing itself. The Astro image cache only matters for the `bun run build` step (local or CI).
- CI caches the Astro image directory separately from `node_modules` to survive dependency updates.
- If remote image builds fail in CI, check rate limits on the CDN and verify the Astro image cache is warm.

## Image Service (@erfianugrah/astro-image-hq)

- Production builds use the [`@erfianugrah/astro-image-hq`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erfianugrah/astro-image-hq) custom Astro image service (configured in `astro.config.mjs`).
- Profile is `photo`: hybrid routing - 4:2:0 10-bit fast path (NVENC > avifenc-svt > sharp) for typical content, with content-aware shadow boost promoting dark gradient images to 4:4:4 10-bit aom.
- Routing guards (since 0.1.x): codec capability detection runs at startup, and per-image constraints can drop the requested codec before encode - SVT-AV1 needs a >=64px smallest side and even dimensions for 4:2:0 (odd dimensions fall back to aom, which handles them internally), NVENC needs >=128px frames (falls back to sharp). Dimensions are re-validated after resize and encode failures retry with the next encoder in the chain.
- Since 0.1.5: alpha-bearing images route off SVT/NVENC to aom to preserve transparency. 4:2:0 AVIF output is clamped to even dimensions (odd-dim AVIFs fail to decode in Firefox). The package version is hashed into `propertiesToHash` so upgrades invalidate consumer image caches.
- Override precedence is **boost-as-floor**: profile defaults → component override (`<Image quality={N} />`) → shadow boost merges last. Bright images take the component value; dark gradients get clamped up by the boost.
- Falls back to sharp 8-bit with a warning when `avifenc` is missing -- local dev still works without it.
- Required system package: `libavif` on Arch, `libavif-bin` on Debian/Ubuntu. CI installs it via apt before `bun install` (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
- Optional: ffmpeg + `av1_nvenc` for GPU-accelerated AVIF -- produces 4:2:0 only (8-bit or 10-bit); routing skips NVENC when 4:4:4 chroma is requested.
- Source code lives at https://github.com/erfianugrah/astro-image-hq (`~/astro-image-hq` for local development). Bump the `@erfianugrah/astro-image-hq` version in `package.json` then `bun install` to consume releases.
- When running locally without `avifenc`, the build still completes via sharp fallback. Banding may be visible in dark photographs; install `libavif` for the full fix.
- Image transforms cost ~150-500ms via NVENC (GPU), ~1-2s via avifenc-svt (CPU 4:2:0), ~3-5s via avifenc-aom (CPU 4:4:4 boosted). A cold full build takes 5-8 minutes wall clock; a warm `node_modules/.astro/assets/` cache revalidates in seconds.
- Releases use OIDC trusted publishing via tag push (no `NPM_TOKEN`).

## Formatting

- Prettier is the formatting authority; config lives in `.prettierrc.mjs`.
- `prettier-plugin-astro` handles `.astro` files.
- Use 2-space indentation; prefer double quotes unless a file already uses a different local convention.
- Do not reformat unrelated files just because you touched one file.
- Preserve file-local style in vendored or generated-style code.

## Imports

- Use ESM imports only; `package.json` sets `"type": "module"`.
- Group imports as framework/external packages, then internal modules, then styles when relevant.
- Use relative imports; no `@/` path alias is configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- Use `import { type Foo }` when importing types from value modules.
- Follow nearby extension style for local imports instead of mass-normalizing files.
- Common Astro imports include `astro:content`, `astro:assets`, and `astro:transitions`.

## TypeScript and Astro Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode via `tsconfig.json` extending `astro/tsconfigs/base` with `strictNullChecks: true`. No JSX transform is configured -- React has been removed.
- Keep shared types near the module that owns them; export them when reused.
- Use `satisfies` for object literals when it improves safety, as in `src/index.ts`.
- In `.astro` files, define a `Props` interface when the component accepts props.
- Prefer explicit return types for exported helpers when the shape is not obvious.
- Avoid `any`; use unions, interfaces, generics, or Zod-backed data shapes instead.

## Vanilla Island Patterns

- Interactivity is handled by vanilla `.astro` components with inline `<script>` blocks.
- Each script wires DOM inside an `astro:page-load` event handler so it survives ClientRouter view-transition swaps.
- Cleanup closures tear down previous listeners before re-adding, preventing accumulation across navigations.
- The four interactive islands are:
  - **ThemeToggle.astro**: SVG sun/moon toggle; dispatches `theme-toggle` event; CSS drives dark-state visuals; `theme.ts` handles localStorage and the `dark` class.
  - **Hamburger.astro**: Mobile menu toggle with 3-bar-to-X animation, Escape key handler, and click-outside-to-close.
  - **ScrollToTop.astro**: rAF-throttled visibility toggle; smooth `window.scrollTo`; transparent background with inherited-colour chevron.
  - **HeroImage.astro**: Parallax hero with translate3d scroll, IntersectionObserver gate, rAF+lerp loop, fade-in on load, and `prefers-reduced-motion` respect.
- The `scripts/` directory holds shared logic (theme, lightbox) as plain TypeScript modules -- no React, no JSX.

## Astro Component Patterns

- Server-rendered `.astro` components are the default choice.
- Use frontmatter for imports, derived values, and async work.
- Keep layouts responsible for document metadata, shared structure, and page-level scripts.
- Reuse existing helpers like `buildDetailPaths()`, `buildTagPaths()`, and `generateRss()` instead of duplicating route logic.
- Prefer extending existing content/layout abstractions over creating parallel page-specific implementations.

## Styling and Tailwind

- Tailwind CSS v4.2.2 is wired through `@tailwindcss/vite` in `astro.config.mjs`.
- All config lives in `src/styles/global.css` as `@theme` blocks, `@plugin` directives, and `@custom-variant` declarations. No separate Tailwind config file exists.
- Dark mode uses `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))`.
- Custom breakpoints are defined in the `@theme` block: `sm=800`, `md=1200`, `lg=1900`, `xl=2500`.
- Font families center on `Inconsolata` and `Overpass Mono` (defined as `--font-overpass-mono` and `--font-inconsolata` in `@theme`).
- Prefer utility classes first; add custom CSS only for masonry, lightbox, imported CV styling, or layout edge cases.
- The typography plugin is loaded via `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` in `global.css`. ESM imports work natively with Tailwind v4.2.2 -- the old `require()` workaround is no longer needed.

## Naming Conventions

- Components and layouts use PascalCase (`Header.astro`, `ThemeToggle.astro`, `BaseLayout.astro`).
- Utility modules use camelCase (`sortByDate.ts`, `collections.ts`).
- Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`SITE_TITLE`).
- Functions and locals use camelCase; types and interfaces use PascalCase.
- Content files use `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx`.
- Draft content files begin with `_` and are excluded by the glob loaders.

## Content Collection Rules

- Collections are defined in `src/content.config.ts` using Zod schemas and Astro glob loaders.
- Shared frontmatter lives in `baseSchema`; the CV collection extends it with structured resume data.
- Keep collection names consistent across schemas, routes, pages, and CLI scripts.
- If you add or rename a collection, update both `src/content.config.ts` and the helpers in `scripts/`.
- Preserve existing frontmatter formatting unless a tool intentionally rewrites it.
- `src/content/cv/cv-export.html` is imported/generated content; edit it carefully and avoid incidental cleanup.

## Content Tooling

- `bun run create` and `bun run update-post` wrap Node scripts in `scripts/`.
- `node scripts/parser.js` checks schema drift between the CLI tools and `src/content.config.ts`.
- When editing content tooling, verify both the runtime command and the drift checker.

## Error Handling and Defensive Coding

- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing for nullable content data.
- Guard DOM queries like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and mutation observers.
- Wrap `localStorage` access in `try/catch`; `src/scripts/theme.ts` is the reference pattern.
- Throw explicit errors for invalid required runtime or build state, for example missing `context.site` for RSS generation.
- Prefer small, explicit runtime guards over deeply nested assumptions.

## Generated and Deployment-Sensitive Files

- Do not commit `dist/` or `.env` files.
- Cloudflare Worker entrypoint is `src/index.ts`; keep it minimal and edge-safe.
- Wrangler config lives in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Deployment Notes

- Deployment target is Cloudflare Workers (static assets); a Docker image is built for container hosting. Deploys are atomic and asset URLs are content-hashed, so no cache purge step exists.

## Agent Workflow Recommendations

- Read the nearby file first and follow its established style before editing.
- Prefer the smallest effective change; avoid broad refactors unless the task requires them.
- Run the narrowest relevant verification command after each change.
- Before handoff on substantive code changes, prefer `bun run lint:site` if time permits.
- If you touch content tooling or collection schemas, also run `node scripts/parser.js`.
- Update this file whenever repo conventions, scripts, or rule sources change.
